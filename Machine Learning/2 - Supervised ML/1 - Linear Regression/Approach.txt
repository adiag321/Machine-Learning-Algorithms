How to Approach a Machine Learning Problem

Here's a strategy you can apply to approach any machine learning problem:

1. Explore the data and find correlations between inputs and targets
2. Pick the right model, loss functions and optimizer for the problem at hand
3. Scale numeric variables and one-hot encode categorical data
4. Set aside a test set (using a fraction of the training set)
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions on the test set and compute the loss
